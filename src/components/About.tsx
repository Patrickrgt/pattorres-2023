            Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
            <br />
            I'm Pat, a Full-Stack Developer based in NYC. ðŸ—½
          </Header>
          <Description>
            I have recently graduated with Bachelor of Science in Computer
            Science, with a focus on Big Data Management and Analytics, from the
            New York Institute of Technology. Currently, I am pursuing my
            Masters of Science in Computer Science.
            <br />
            <br />
            My passion lies in building products through collaboration with
            diverse teams and communities. I have a strong commitment to helping
            bring visions to reality through partnerships with artists,
            developers, and leaders.
            <br />
            <br />
            I have had the privilege of working with renowned artists Vinne and
            Kyo to create the Aiko Virtual NFT collection. Additionally, I have
            also gained experience in entrepreneurship through running an LLC
            focused on the sales of limited edition sneakers and apparel. During
            my time as a Community Manager at Aiko Virtual, I learned the
            importance of staying connected and building relationships with
            other creatives in the NFT space.
            <br />
            <br />I possess a broad range of skills in frontend, backend, and
            database technologies, with a focus on full-stack development. I am
            always seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my
            knowledge and expertise.
            <br />
            <br />
            Aside from programing and web development, I have a passion for:
            <br />
            Digital Art ðŸŽ¨
            <br />
            Music Production ðŸŽµ
            <br />
            Graphic Design ðŸŽ¨
